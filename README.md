# Generasi Gigih 3.0 Mobile Engineering Track
This is entry point document for Mobile Engineering Final Project

## Mid and Final Project
### Requirement
- List disaster in x period
- Filterable List (flood, earthquake, fire, haze, volcano, etc)
- Filter based on area 
- Show disaster on Map (Participant can use Google Maps, Mapbox, or other similar open source map)
- Notification Alert based on water level
- Support light/dark theme
- Animation Loading

### Additional Requirement for Final Term:
- Use Dependecies Injection with Dagger or Hilt
- Implementing Unit Test (Please put the coverage test result in documentation)
- Implementing Instrument Test for all main use case (Please put link video of the instrumentation flow in the documentation)

## Expectation
We expect participants to start working on this Final Project from day one. We have 2 grading systems, Mid term and Final term. Grader will evaluate these 3 main point below
- Functionality, all features should be working properly without any bugs
- Documentation, provide documentation (Code documentation and project documentation)
- Code Hygiene, follow engineering best practice
### Additional for Final Term:
`Concept` 
- Implementing Design Pattern that we already learn, at least MVVM and DI
- Implementing SOLID Principle, at least SOID
